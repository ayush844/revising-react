create a .env file in root folder:

## here we are using vite for creating react app so we'll use (VITE_NAME) for naming our variables like this:
VITE_APPWRITE_URL="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1" 
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="6626bc72250dd0e2091f"
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="6626c9834fddf03f67c1"
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID="6626c9bce3f504f835c6"
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID="6626cbddda1aaeb6584b"

## to access these variables present in .env we'll use (import.meta.env.VARIABLE-NAME) [here because we are using vite]:
| console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL);


we'll add .env to gitignore

since we can't ship .env file to github we make a new file .env.sample that will be shipped to github. In this file we just write name of all variables that we declared in .env file like this:
VITE_APPWRITE_URL="" 
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=""
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=""


now make a project and database in appwrite and fill the variables in .env file.

# if we don't always want to write import.meta.env.VITE_NAME to access the .env variable we can also write some method in a new file 
now create a folder conf and a file inside it config.js.


|const conf = {
|    appwriteUrl: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),
|    appwriteProjectId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID),
|    appwriteDatabaseId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID),
|    appwriteCollectionId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID),
|    appwriteBucketId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID)
|}
|
|export default conf


now we can can acces it by:

| console.log(conf.appwriteProjectId);
